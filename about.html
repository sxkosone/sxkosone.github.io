      <p class="lead">How moving from Finland to Florida helped me finally pursue coding.</p>
      <img class="img-medium" src="images/mina-pyora2.jpg" alt="Me and my bicycle in Helsinki, 2017. Picture by Roosa Murto."/>

      <p>My journey started quite far away. I was born and raised in Finland, but in the end of year 2017, I moved to Tampa, Florida. The change of years 2017 and 2018 were a hectic time: I finished my Master’s degree in Journalism and graduated, and was finally able to dedicate my time to coding.</p>
      <p>I love writing, learning and storytelling, and that lead me to pursue journalism and work in a prominent Finnish newspaper and TV channel. However, there was another childhood dream I still wanted to pursue: inventing. And that's what coding is to me.</p>

      <p>Programming is inventing new services, solving problems, seeing your ideas come into reality. I want to build websites and apps with user experience and great looks always in mind. My previous job as a digital content producer had already lead me to improving our Wordpress-based website, by using Google Analytics, SEO and HTML. I didn’t even realize it at the time, but I was spending a big portion of weeks on User Experience design. The results motivated me to continue - we doubled our visitors in a year and improved our visibility greatly. To be honest, I was also frustrated at not being able to implement all the features I hoped for, lacking the coding knowledge. That’s why I wanted to focus on web development, to learn and create.</p>
