      <h1>From one beginner to another: Four things that help me get unstuck</h1>
      <p class="timestamp">Published March 10th 2018</p>
      <p class="lead">I’m teaching myself how to program. It’s a journey - on a horse-carriage, in a swamp, with 50 more miles to the nearest village. This is to say I get stuck a lot. These are the things that have helped me get back on the move.</p>

      <h2>Google new terms into submission</h2>
      <p>Google is your friend! It’s ridiculous how bummed I would be about all the new terms, when all they take is a quick Google search. Of course, in the absolute beginning, it doesn’t help you much to learn that Angular is a framework, when you don’t know what a framework is. But then you Google ‘framework’. And watch tutorials. And read blog posts. Every new term you learn, whether big or small, will clarify the big picture of all those intertwined coding technologies out there. It took time, but now I no longer get (emotionally) stuck on new terms. I just read, google and repeat.

      <h2>Start building as soon as possible</h2>
      <p>Front-end development is particularly rewarding, because you can see the results of what you’ve learnt immediately. Nothing beats the sensation of finally cracking that coding nut and being able to “make the computer do something”, to put it bluntly. With imperative languages like Java, Python and JavaScript, you can soon get on building small programs like chatbots, calculators or games. I love studying the coding languages through websites like Codecademy. However, only using that language to actually build some small programs has helped me grow my resilience and learn how to get unstuck. These are essential skills to an aspiring web developer.</p>

      <h2>Ask and get support</h2>
      <p>Most beginners’ guides told me this, but I was still reluctant. Why would I go and ask for support when I’ll most likely be ignored or my questions will be laughed at? No thank you, I’d rather struggle alone instead of revealing how bad I am at this.</p>

      <p>Wrong. Asking for help might be uncomfortable, but it certainly won’t mean that you’re the only one struggling. Instead, it might give you the healthy reminder that there are other people out there that are also stuck. You might meet people that are all on their own leg of the coding journey and you’ll see that maybe you’re not so stuck behind as you thought you were. I have received lots of inspiration and support from my local Girl Develop It meetup group. For you, support might be something else and that’s fine. But sooner or later, try to find support either online or offline, and you’ll see big gains in your motivation. And hey, asking for help is an important skill for a wannabe developer, so you better start practicing already!</p>

        <h2>It’s gonna be hard. Accept it and embrace it.</h2>
        <p>Feeling like I don’t belong - that’s my biggest risk for quitting coding. I have to be honest, no matter how much I like programming, some difficult moments make me think that I’m just not cut out for this. The thought is poisonous, because it clouds your judgement and problem solving. Instead of focusing on how to solve the problem, you’re focusing on how incompetent you supposedly are. However, you have no other option than to accept that programming is inherently hard, and that you will struggle, like everyone else! It’s quite a freeing thought, in my opinion.</p>
